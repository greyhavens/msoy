/**
 *  Determines the color of a ProgressBar.
 *  A ProgressBar is filled with a vertical gradient between this color
 *  and a brighter color computed from it.
 *  This style has no effect on other components, but can be set on a container
 *  to control the appearance of all progress bars found within.
 *  The default value is <code>undefined</code>, which means it is not set. 
 *  In this case, the <code>themeColor</code> style property is used.
